# E-Wallet Brand Health Case Study and Presentation

#Disclaimer: The data is only a dummy dataset. Please use this case study solely for study purposes. I hope my analysis provides a helpful overview for those interested in marketing research.

## Introduction of this case
This case study is based on dummy data but reflects the actual conditions of a real-world case study from NielsenIQ. In 2022, after graduating with my bachelor's degree, I applied for a full-time Consumer Insight role at NielsenIQ. I was tasked with analyzing e-wallet survey data and delivering actionable insights and recommendations within only 2 hours of preparation. Then, I needed to present my results to both future users and the director. My successful execution of this high-stakes project resulted in a coveted job offer from NielsenIQ.

As a management graduate with a strong interest in market research, this opportunity was a dream come true. Unfortunately, I gave up this offer because I decided to accept a scholarship to study in Taiwan, which further advanced my academic and professional growth. Here is the detailed information about this case.
